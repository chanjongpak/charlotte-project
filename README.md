# Next Steps for Charlotte.

Implementing of filter functionality to be able to query a search and return relevant results shouldn't be too far fetched and will significantly improve user experience. The ability to pull key search terms is a pivotal feature of any search bar within a website. Furthering this feature would be to also pull similar search results that may not necessarily have any key terms but fall under the "You may also be interested in" category.

Being able to have record of user attended events allows for greater accessbility in finding other events by the same host and in being able to rate/review for future reference. Mostly a QOL change in pursuit of attaining the pinnacle of user experience.

Addition of a map function that will both ask users for permission to access their location via location services and show pings on a map for events. User experience boils down to the readability of the content provided and the ease with which it is able to be digested, as such, ideally users will be able to eat with their eyes to be able to better gauge the location of any/all events. Being able to see where something is in regards to your current location is undoubtedly more useful than seeing a typed out address.
